# StudentLogger

The purpose of this project was to create a keylogger that was able monitor student engagement during there academic work.
The keylogger created runs in the background, whilst students complete there academic work. Data is collected and is then displayed within graphs that show number of words over time, as well as most used key words. This data can be used to justify if the student has been engaged in there academic work. All data is encypted using AES and RSA encryption.
